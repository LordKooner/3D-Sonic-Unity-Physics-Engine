# The uploaded files are the scripts I made for the thing

### "script_player" 
is for the player object, which is a sphere object with a 0.5 radius, aside from the script, the player has the components RigidBody, and SphereCollider added with no changes made to them.

### "script_camera"
is a script I added to Main Camera to make it so it follows the player object.

### "script_CCV" and "script_CCV2"
are two scripts I made for two small sphereical objects, their purpose was to visualize the location of the collision detection for testing purposes. 

# Features
Like I said, the engine is a pretty simple Sonic engine.
The player accelerates, deaccelerates, goes up and down slopes, and is able to, manually, do the well-known Sonic game's loop de loops.
